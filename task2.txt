;;This program takes in two nonnegative integers, one base and one exponent and writes the base^exponent

allocate-registers base, exponent, pow, loop1, loop2, num


;;After allocating registers, we can take in the input from the user of the base and exponent

read base
read exponent
li num 1
li pow 1
li loop1, loop
li loop2, end

loop:
	
	jeqz exponent loop2
	
	;;If the exponent is 0 from the start, we can jump straight to the end of the program. Otherwise, the program will continue 	;;down the line of code here
	
	mul pow pow base
	sub exponent exponent num
	;;After multiplying the base and exponent, we can subtract one from the exponent and run through the loop again, if needed
	j loop1

end:
	;;After going through the loop enough times, we arrive at the end section which prints out the power and stops
	write pow
