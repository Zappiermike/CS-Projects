;;This very basic program takes in two integers a/home/mscheie/Documents/Task1.txtnd then writes the sum of the two numbers squared. This program also doesnâ€™t need to allocate any registers because of how it is set up.

read 00
read 01
;;These first two read the two numbers that the user would input
mul 03 00 00
mul 04 01 01
;;We then multiply the numbers by themselves to get the squared problem
add 05 03 04
;;We add the two squared numbers together and place in register 5
write 05
halt
